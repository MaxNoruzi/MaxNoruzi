## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔍 Crime Analysis AI
Analyzed real-world crime data using preprocessing, trend analysis, and Apriori association rule mining.  
Extracted patterns based on time, location, and offense type to uncover meaningful crime correlations.

### ✍️ SOP Creator AI
Built an AI system that generates personalized Statements of Purpose using academic program data and GPT-based generation.  
Applied advanced text preprocessing and structured prompt design for intelligent output.

### 📐 MIPS Assembly Toolkit
Collection of low-level programs including custom multiplication, exponentiation, matrix multiplication, triangle validation, and bitwise rotation.  
Great for system-level thinking and performance-focused logic design.

### 🔗 NS-3 Blockchain Node Simulation
Simulated a blockchain network using NS-3. Each node mines, broadcasts, and validates blocks via UDP in a peer-to-peer architecture.
